      <description>A Clock stopped —
Not the Mantel&amp;rsquo;s —
Geneva&amp;rsquo;s farthest skill
Can&amp;rsquo;t put the puppet bowing —
That just now dangled still —\
An awe came on the Trinket!
The Figures hunched, with pain —
Then quivered out of Decimals —
Into Degreeless Noon —
It will not stir for Doctors —
This Pendulum of snow —
The Shopman importunes it —
While cool — concernless No —
Nods from the Gilded pointers —</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there&amp;rsquo;s a pair of us — don&amp;rsquo;t tell!
They&amp;rsquo;d banish us, you know.
How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!</description>

      <description>Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility.
We passed the school, where children strove
At recess, in the ring;
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.
Or rather, he passed us;</description>
