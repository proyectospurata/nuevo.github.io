      <description>Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away

For his civility.

At recess, in the ring;
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.
Or rather, he passed us;</description>
